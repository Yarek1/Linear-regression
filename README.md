# Linear-regression
Simple linear regression using normal equations with normality tests

Linear regression is one of the most important and popular predictive techniques in data analysis. 
It’s also one of the oldest - famous C.F. Gauss at the beginning of 19th-century was using it in the astronomy for calculation of orbits (more).

Normal Equation is an analytical approach to Linear Regression with a Least Square Cost Function.
We can directly find out the value of θ without using Gradient Descent.
Following this approach is an effective and a time-saving option when are working with a dataset with small features.

After applying normal equations importance of linear regression coefficients was tested and also residuals was checked to visualize outliers.

QQplot and tests used in project check normality of provided dataset.
In statistics, a Q–Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, 
which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.
